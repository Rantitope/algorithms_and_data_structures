This is because the BFS algorithm processes each node exactly once, checking its value and adding its children to the queue if they exist. Checking for duplicates in the visited set and adding new values are both O(1) operations. Therefore, the overall runtime is dominated by the linear traversal of the tree, making the time complexity proportional to the number of nodes.\n",

The queue holds the nodes of one level at a time, and in the worst-case scenario (e.g., a balanced binary tree), it may contain up to half the nodes at the last level, or approximately n/2. Additionally, the visited set stores all the unique values encountered during traversal, which in the worst case can be all n node values if there are no duplicates. Together, the queue and the set require space proportional to the number of nodes, leading to an overall space complexity of O(n)."

    "The partner's solution is efficient and well-suited for the problem, using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to prioritize nodes closer to the root when identifying duplicates. The choice of a set to track visited values is effective, as it ensures O(1) time complexity for duplicate checks and insertions. By processing each node only once, the solution achieves an optimal time complexity of O(n), while the queue and set usage result in a space complexity of O(n). The edge case of an empty tree is also handled correctly by returning -1 when root is None, showcasing that the solution covers basic edge cases.\n",

Adding more detailed comments and better variable naming would increase code readability and make the intent of each step clearer. For instance, naming queue as bfs_queue or node_queue and visited as seen_values could enhance clarity. The code could also include additional robustness checks, such as ensuring root is a valid TreeNode. Testing edge cases, like a single-node tree or a tree with all identical values, would further strengthen the solution. While functionally correct, these adjustments would make the code easier to understand, maintain, and integrate into larger systems."

Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as implementing traversal logic, managing visited nodes, and identifying edge cases, helped clarify the solution structure. Working with BFS allowed us to prioritize finding duplicates closest to the root, which aligned perfectly with the problem requirements. While implementing the solution, I also revisited key concepts, such as the differences between BFS and DFS, to ensure the approach chosen was the most appropriate.\n",

I also found that summarizing and paraphrasing their work pushed me to think critically and articulate concepts more clearly. Overall, this assignment reinforced my problem-solving skills and taught me the value of constructive feedback.
